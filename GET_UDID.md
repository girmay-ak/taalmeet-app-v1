# Get Your iPhone UDID - Quick Guide

## Easiest Method: Use UDID Website

1. **On your iPhone**, open Safari
2. Go to: **https://udid.tech** or **https://get.udid.io**
3. Tap **"Get UDID"** or **"Tap to find UDID"**
4. You'll be asked to install a profile - tap **"Allow"** (this is safe, it only reads your UDID)
5. Go to **Settings** > **General** > **VPN & Device Management**
6. Tap the profile that was just installed
7. Tap **"Install"** (this is just to read your UDID, not a developer profile)
8. Your UDID will be displayed - **copy it**

## Alternative: From iPhone Settings

1. Go to **Settings** > **General** > **About**
2. Scroll down and look for **"Identifier"** 
3. It's a long string like: `00008030-001A1D1234567890`
4. **Copy this UDID**

## Then Register It

Once you have the UDID, we'll register it with EAS.
